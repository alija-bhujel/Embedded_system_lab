# Embedded System VHDL Lab assignments
This repository contains my solutions to various VHDL lab assignments. The code is compiled using GHDL and the waveforms is visualized using GTKWave. The development environment used is Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

## How to Run
1.Requiremets 
a.GHDL/n
b.GTK Wave/n
c.VS code/n
## How to Start
1.Clone the repository
 git clone https://github.com/alija-bhujel/Embedded_system_lab.git
 cd Embedded_system_lab
 Steps to follow:
 Installing GHDL/n
 Installing GTKWave/n
 Installing make tools/n

 ## After installation
 
 * go to specific file of which you want to observe the output in terminal for eg:
$ cd gcd
Run the Makefile by
$ make

This will create a file result.vcd
To observe output run
$ gtkwave result.vcd
